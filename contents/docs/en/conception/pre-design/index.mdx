title: "Pre-design - Analysis and Planning"
description: "Pre-design methodology to analyze needs, plan architecture, and effectively prepare for the development phase."
---


Pre-design is a crucial phase that precedes development. It allows for in-depth analysis of needs, architecture planning, and making the right technical decisions before starting to code.

## 🎯 Pre-design Objectives

### Why Pre-design?

- **Reduce risks**: Identify potential problems early
- **Optimize costs**: Avoid expensive refactoring
- **Improve quality**: Design solid architecture
- **Accelerate development**: Clarify objectives and constraints
- **Facilitate communication**: Align the entire team

<Note>
**Key principle**: "An hour of planning saves ten hours of development." Pre-design is a profitable investment.

# GitFlow Workflow

GitFlow is a **workflow** that allows working on separated branches, making it semantically easy to identify what changes are brought by different branches.

Using GitFlow is a way to work optimally on a project, using specific branches for specific kinds of changes. It tells everyone, by the nature of the branch, what kind of work has been achieved through this branch.

<Note type="info">
Although GitFlow is just a method to work with Git, a program exists to automate Git usage for the GitFlow workflow, making it much easier to manage branch workflows.
</Note>

## Installation

### Windows

Under Windows, Git already contains the GitFlow module, so if you've already installed Git, you can use GitFlow. Otherwise, [install Git here](https://git-scm.com/download/win).

### Mac

To install the GitFlow module under Mac using HomeBrew:

```bash
brew install git-flow
```

### Linux

<Tabs>
<TabsList>
<TabsTrigger value="apt">APT (Ubuntu/Debian)</TabsTrigger>
<TabsTrigger value="pacman">Pacman (Arch)</TabsTrigger>
</TabsList>

<TabsContent value="apt">
To install GitFlow module under Linux using APT:

```bash
sudo apt-get install git-flow
```
</TabsContent>

<TabsContent value="pacman">
To install GitFlow module under Linux using Pacman:

```bash
sudo pacman -S gitflow-avh
```
</TabsContent>
</Tabs>

## Getting Started

### Initialization

To initialize GitFlow, you have to execute the command:

```bash
git flow init
```

This can be run in a folder that can already be a Git repository, or not.

<Note type="success">
It's recommended to name the main branch as `main` instead of `master` for modern Git practices.

For the rest, you can set the names that you want, although the default names are preferred to be kept in most cases.
</Note>

## Feature Branches

Feature branches are useful when you have to start new feature development. Although they're just basic branches, they bring semantic information about what changes are made through those branches.

They indicate clearly to everybody that the changes made into them will concern new feature development.

### Creation

To create a `feature` branch, nothing could be easier - just run the command:

```bash
git flow feature start <branch_name>
```

![GitFlow Feature](/images/docs/assets/basics/gitflow/gitflow-feature.png)

<Note type="info">
**Equivalent commands without using GitFlow module:**

```bash
git checkout develop
git checkout -b feature/<branch_name>
```
</Note>

### Finalization

When your work is done and you want to add it to the `develop` branch, you just have to do:

```bash
git flow feature finish <branch_name>
git pull origin develop
```

That way, you'll merge the changes you made and pull the changes that others did on the `develop` branch.

<Note type="info">
**Equivalent commands without using GitFlow module:**

```bash
git checkout develop
git merge feature/<branch_name>
git branch -D feature/<branch_name>
git pull origin develop
```
</Note>

## Hotfix Branches

Hotfix branches have semantic utility too - they're used to bring fixes to features or systems involved in your project. These branches are typically created from the main branch to fix critical issues in production.

### Creation

To create a `hotfix` branch, it's easy - you just have to run:

```bash
git flow hotfix start <branch_name>
```

<Note type="info">
**Equivalent commands without using GitFlow module:**

```bash
git checkout main
git checkout -b hotfix/<branch_name>
```
</Note>

### Finalization

When your work is done, you have to close this branch by running:

```bash
git flow hotfix finish <branch_name>
```

<Note type="warning">
**Important:** Hotfix finalization will merge the changes into both `main` and `develop` branches to ensure the fix is present in both production and future development.

**Equivalent commands without using GitFlow module:**

```bash
git checkout main
git merge hotfix/<branch_name>
git checkout develop
git merge hotfix/<branch_name>
git branch -D hotfix/<branch_name>
```
</Note>

## GitFlow Branch Structure

<Stepper>
  <StepperItem title="Main Branch">
    Contains production-ready code. Only receives merges from hotfix and release branches.
  </StepperItem>
  <StepperItem title="Develop Branch">
    Contains the latest development changes. Features are merged here and this is where releases are prepared.
  </StepperItem>
  <StepperItem title="Feature Branches">
    Created from develop for new features. Merged back to develop when complete.
  </StepperItem>
  <StepperItem title="Hotfix Branches">
    Created from main for critical fixes. Merged to both main and develop.
  </StepperItem>
</Stepper>

## Summary

- **GitFlow** is a workflow that provides semantic meaning to different branches
- **Installation** varies by platform but is available for Windows, Mac, and Linux
- **Initialization** with `git flow init` sets up the branch structure
- **Feature branches** are used for new feature development
- **Hotfix branches** are used for critical fixes that need to go to production immediately
- Each branch type has specific creation and finalization commands that automate the underlying Git operations

<Note>
GitFlow is particularly useful for larger teams and projects with regular releases. For smaller projects or teams practicing continuous deployment, simpler workflows like GitHub Flow might be more appropriate.

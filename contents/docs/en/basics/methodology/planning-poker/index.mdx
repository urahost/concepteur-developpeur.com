# Planning Poker

**The Agile method of planning poker consists of a difficulty estimation of tasks founded on a consensus.**

The **Planning Poker**, also known as "**SCRUM Poker**" or "pointing poker", is a playful method that **development teams** use for project management tasks. These **estimations** are **based** on a **consensus** from the whole team, which makes it more accurate than other methods. To help evaluate story points count for relevant tasks, **teams** use planning **poker cards**.

## Card Values and Fibonacci Sequence

The *Fibonacci sequence* is used for evaluations. Since we seek to **quantify the effort**, the message is clear: *the bigger the scenario is*, **the less accurate evaluations will be**.

<Note type="info">
The cards pack used for Planning Poker *must contain* the following values: **1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144**.

Some teams simplify large values by turning them into 20, 40, 100... because the idea is to "be globally good" instead of "be accurately wrong". We generally add 0 and 1/2 values as well.
</Note>

### Card Value Meanings

<TabsTrigger value="medium">Medium Values (5-13)</TabsTrigger>
<TabsTrigger value="large">Large Values (21+)</TabsTrigger>
<TabsTrigger value="special">Special Cards</TabsTrigger>
</TabsList>

<TabsContent value="small">
**0** - No effort required (task already done or not needed)  
**1/2** - Trivial task, minimal effort  
**1** - Very simple task  
**2** - Small task with minor complexity  
**3** - Small to medium task
</TabsContent>

<TabsContent value="medium">
**5** - Medium complexity task  
**8** - Complex task requiring significant effort  
**13** - Large, complex task
</TabsContent>

<TabsContent value="large">
**21+** - Very large tasks that should probably be broken down into smaller stories

These values indicate that the task is too large to estimate accurately and should be decomposed.
</TabsContent>

<TabsContent value="special">
**?** - Not enough information to estimate  
**∞** - Task is too large or impossible  
**☕** - Need a break (lighthearted addition)

## How Planning Poker Works

![Planning Poker Meeting](/images/docs/assets/planning-poker/meeting.jpg)

At the beginning of a Planning Poker session, the **Product Owner** or **the client** reviews an agile user story and reads it **aloud**. A user story is a general and informal explanation of a software feature that describes how it will deliver value to the end user.

### The Process

<Stepper>
  <StepperItem title="Distribute Cards">
    Distribute an identical set of cards to each participant. Each card has a number agreed upon by the team. Mike Cohn recommends a sequence of 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 20, 40, and 100 in his book "*Agile Estimating and Planning*."
  </StepperItem>
  
  <StepperItem title="Read the Story">
    The moderator (**Product Owner**) tells the story to the group. If participants have questions, the moderator answers them.
  </StepperItem>
  
  <StepperItem title="Discuss the Story">
    After the group has finished listening to the story, each person shares their perspective on it.
  </StepperItem>
  
  <StepperItem title="Select and Reveal">
    After the discussion, each person privately chooses a card from the deck. Once everyone has chosen a card, **they reveal them simultaneously**.
  </StepperItem>
  
  <StepperItem title="Achieve Consensus">
    When team members show the same card, that number becomes consensus. If cards vary, further discussion follows until agreement is reached.
  </StepperItem>
</Stepper>

### Detailed Process Steps

#### 1. Distribute Cards to Participants

<Note type="info">
Each player should have a set of cards with different numbers. These values can represent a variety of things: the number of story points, ideal days, or other units the team uses for estimation.

The card sets intentionally have a **minimal level** with significant jumps in numbers. This ensures that for each story, everyone can reach a consensus number. *If there were a card for every number from 1 to 50*, **the process would be terribly slow**.
</Note>

#### 2. Read the Story Aloud

The moderator (**Product Owner**) tells the story to the group. If participants have questions, the moderator answers them with sufficient detail for accurate estimation.

#### 3. Discuss the Story

After the group has finished listening to the story, *each person shares their perspective* on it. Some of the discussion points will likely include questions like:

- How should we approach the work?
- How many people are expected to be involved?
- What skills will be needed to work on the story?
- How to address obstacles that hinder progress?

The group will also try to learn more about the story and ask questions to better understand it.

#### 4. Select and Reveal

After the discussion, each person privately chooses a card from the deck. Typically, it's used to show an estimation of the story points (but it can also represent the number of ideal days). Once everyone has chosen a card, **they reveal them simultaneously**.

<Note type="warning">
If a player shows a higher card, it means the **story** will be **completed** with more **difficulty** and more **time committed**. Keep in mind that it's common for estimates to vary significantly initially.
</Note>

#### 5. Achieve Consensus

When team members show the same card, that number becomes consensus. At that point, the group can proceed and work on the next story. However, if the cards continue to vary, further discussions about the story will follow.

<Note type="success">
Participants whose estimates are higher or lower than others will communicate their perspective. They will then attempt to explain to their teammates the reasons for the divergence. Once this additional deliberation is complete, everyone will review their cards and reveal them again.

Generally, estimates start to converge after the second round. If that's not the case, the process is repeated until the team agrees on a single number.
</Note>

## Benefits of Planning Poker

According to studies, *estimates from Planning Poker* are **statistically more accurate** than **individual estimates**.

### Key Benefits

</TabsList>

<TabsContent value="relative">
### Estimating Tasks Relative to Each Other

It is *often challenging to gauge the absolute time needed for a project*, especially when it's the first time. Planning Poker allows teams to become familiar with their assessments.

After playing the game for some time, *you will eventually build a set of tasks that serve as future reference for comparison*.

**Benefits:**
- Creates a shared understanding of complexity
- Builds team estimation capabilities over time
- Provides reference points for future estimates
</TabsContent>

<TabsContent value="voice">
### Giving Equal Voice to All Team Members

It can encourage new employees to speak up by playing a card and explaining their logic.

**Example scenario:**
Imagine you are building a food reservation app. You and your colleague might provide a smaller estimate, like 5 or 8. On the other hand, a new employee might give an estimate of 21. Perhaps they have experience from creating a similar app in their previous job and know that such an app takes a lot of time, especially in comparison to others.

**Benefits:**
- Prevents dominant personalities from influencing estimates
- Encourages participation from all team members
- Leverages diverse experience and perspectives
</TabsContent>

<TabsContent value="gaps">
### Identifying Gaps in Requirements and Implementation

When participants disclose their estimates, they have to support them by explaining why they are high or low. This can trigger questions about requirements and implementation – a feedback loop that helps detect gaps.

**Benefits:**
- Reveals hidden complexities early
- Improves requirement understanding
- Identifies implementation challenges before development starts

## Who Should Participate in Planning Poker

![Planning Poker Team](/images/docs/assets/planning-poker/team.jpg)

The right people need to join the meeting, otherwise, it becomes difficult to reap the benefits described above. These crucial roles are as follows:

<Note type="info">
**Essential Participants:**

- **Scrum Team Members**: Provide items for the Product Backlog and contribute to discussions on story points
- **Scrum Master**: Facilitates agile meetings and should participate in all (or nearly all) meetings
- **Product Owner**: Describes all user stories to the team and answers their questions
</Note>

### Optional Participants

- **Technical Architects**: For complex technical stories
- **UX/UI Designers**: For user interface and experience stories
- **Quality Assurance**: For stories with significant testing implications
- **Subject Matter Experts**: When specialized knowledge is required

## When to Organize Planning Poker Meetings

### Initial Planning

In general, teams organize a session **after creating the initial backlog**. While sessions can sometimes take **more than one day**, they help in establishing **useful initial estimates** for project sizing or scoping.

### Ongoing Planning

Items are added to the Product Backlog **incrementally throughout the project's lifespan**. That's why it's typically more practical for teams to conduct sessions *once per iteration*.

<Note type="success">
**Best timing practices:**

- **After sprint completion**: A few days after the end of the iteration
- **During backlog refinement**: Regular grooming sessions
- **Just after daily standup**: When the whole team is present
- **Before sprint planning**: To have estimates ready for planning
</Note>

### Session Frequency

- **Weekly**: For teams with rapidly changing backlogs
- **Bi-weekly**: Most common approach, aligned with sprint cycles  
- **Monthly**: For stable teams with well-defined backlogs
- **Ad-hoc**: When new complex stories are added

## Best Practices and Tips

<Stepper>
  <StepperItem title="Keep Sessions Focused">
    Limit sessions to 2-3 hours maximum. Break large sessions into multiple shorter ones.
  </StepperItem>
  
  <StepperItem title="Prepare Stories in Advance">
    Ensure all stories have clear acceptance criteria and are well-defined before the session.
  </StepperItem>
  
  <StepperItem title="Don't Average Estimates">
    Work toward consensus rather than mathematical averages. The discussion is more valuable than the numbers.
  </StepperItem>
  
  <StepperItem title="Break Down Large Stories">
    If a story receives consistently high estimates (13+), consider breaking it into smaller pieces.
  </StepperItem>
  
  <StepperItem title="Document Assumptions">
    Record key assumptions and decisions made during estimation for future reference.
  </StepperItem>
</Stepper>

## Conclusion

Planning Poker is a powerful technique that combines the benefits of expert estimation with team collaboration. It helps teams create more accurate estimates while building shared understanding and identifying potential issues early in the development process.

<Note type="success">
**Key Success Factors:**
- Ensure all team members participate actively
- Focus on discussion and understanding, not just numbers
- Use estimates for planning, not for measuring team performance
- Continuously refine your estimation skills as a team
</Note>

The collaborative nature of Planning Poker makes it an essential tool for Agile teams looking to improve their estimation accuracy and build better products through shared understanding and consensus-based planning.

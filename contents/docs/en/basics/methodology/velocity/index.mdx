# Velocity in SCRUM

**Velocity** is an indicator used in projects managed using an agile method, for instance with the **SCRUM** framework. Agile velocity helps determine the effort an agile development team can provide for completing tasks scheduled within a sprint. It is expressed in terms of points.

## Understanding Velocity

The **Product Owner** places a certain number of features or items to be realized during the sprint in the **Product Backlog**, generally formalized as *user stories*. The development team assigns a certain number of points to each **Product Backlog Item (PBI)**. These points represent both the complexity and the estimated duration of completing the PBI empirically.

<Note type="info">
It is not a linear scale; the **Fibonacci sequence** is often used for story point estimation.
</Note>

### Story Point Values

The values that can be assigned include:

### Velocity Calculation Example

<Note type="success">
**Important principle:** The velocity in future iterations will be more or less equal to the previous one.

**Example:** If *stories A* and *B* (each estimated at *2 points*) are 100% complete, and story *C* (*3 points*) is only 80% complete, the iteration's velocity will be *4 points* (only completed stories count).
</Note>

![Velocity Calculation](/images/docs/assets/velocity/what-is-velocity-2.png)

Velocity can also be calculated by considering *story points*. The velocity of a specific sprint is calculated by multiplying the number of completed *user stories* in the sprint by the *story points* assigned to each user story.

**Example calculation:**
- Completed user stories: 4
- Story points per story: 3
- **Total velocity = 4 ร 3 = 12 points**

## How to Use Average Velocity in Agile Development

**Agile** is synonymous with iterative development, rapid solutions, and rapid product market entry. To achieve this, Agile teams must know how much work they can do in a sprint and how long it will take to complete the project or deliver a functional version to the client.

### Calculating Average Velocity

<Note type="info">
Average velocity is calculated once the project has progressed through **three or four sprints** (iterations). Average velocity is calculated by averaging the story points accumulated in each sprint.
</Note>

**Practical example:**
- Sprint 1: 10 points
- Sprint 2: 12 points  
- Sprint 3: 14 points
- Sprint 4: 12 points
- **Average velocity = (10 + 12 + 14 + 12) รท 4 = 12 points per sprint**

### Project Planning with Velocity

Using the example above of the average velocity of a sprint, you can assume that the team can complete work at a rate of *12 story points* per sprint. So, if you have *120 story points* left to complete in your project, you can estimate that you'll need *10 more sprints* to finish the project.

<Note type="warning">
While this calculation is generally accurate, it's subject to fluctuations depending on changing requirements, team size, and project complexity.
</Note>

## Agile Velocity Chart

The **Agile method** offers various tools to visually represent data points. These tools provide an easy indicator of project progress, and if cloud-based, they can be accessed by all project stakeholders.

Agile velocity charts are essentially graphs, with *story points* displayed on one axis, and completed sprints shown on the opposite axis. They are an excellent way to make your project's velocity accessible to everyone.

### Reading Velocity Charts

A velocity chart is a great way to:
- **Track project progress** over time
- **Identify consistency** in team performance
- **Spot patterns** in the team's sprint velocity
- **Detect irregularities** that might indicate problems

<Note type="warning">
If your charts show many irregular peaks and troughs, you might conclude that your project is unpredictable, as velocity isn't consistent.
</Note>

## Benefits of Measuring Velocity

### Essential for Release Planning

<Note type="success">
Velocity is crucial for release planning as it helps the Product Owner determine how many sprints are needed to create a product with the desired features. By estimating the number of necessary sprints, the Product Owner can estimate the release date.
</Note>

### Feedback for the Team

Velocity is an excellent metric for measuring the team's progress. By tracking velocity over time, teams can measure whether the changes they make during the sprint improve or reduce productivity.

- **New teams**: Velocity can fluctuate significantly
- **Experienced teams**: Have consistent velocity and can measure progress through velocity charts

### Forecasting

Velocity helps the team identify how many user stories they can complete in a sprint. **Predictability** is an important factor that helps teams make decisions about project timelines and budgets.

<Note type="info">
Forecasting is usually done by taking the average velocity of the **last three sprints**.
</Note>

## Drawbacks and Limitations

### Empirical Nature

<Note type="warning">
While velocity is an excellent metric for measuring the team's progress, it's important to remember that it's an **empirical measure**, which means it can be used for estimation but not as the final standard for measuring the team's progress.
</Note>

Velocity is often based on *story points*, which are subjective to the team. Teams may have their own values for *story points* for user stories and, therefore, define their velocity and scope of work.

### Common Issues

<TabsList>
<TabsTrigger value="startup">Startup Issues</TabsTrigger>
<TabsTrigger value="tasks">Task Breakdown</TabsTrigger>
<TabsTrigger value="downtime">Downtime</TabsTrigger>
</TabsList>

<TabsContent value="startup">
**Startup Issues**

Velocity is better estimated by mature and well-established Scrum teams. New or transitioning teams and teams embarking on new projects will need time to become well-oiled machines and achieve accurate velocity.

**Solutions:**
- Allow 3-4 sprints for velocity to stabilize
- Focus on consistency rather than high numbers initially
- Use velocity trends rather than absolute values
</TabsContent>

<TabsContent value="tasks">
**Significant Task Breakdown Issues**

Scrum/Agile works on the principle of breaking large projects into smaller pieces. If Epics are not sufficiently comprehensive, it will directly affect velocity, and teams may see a significant drop in velocity from one sprint to another.

**Solutions:**
- Ensure consistent story sizing across sprints
- Break down large stories into smaller, manageable pieces
- Maintain a definition of "Done" for consistency
</TabsContent>

<TabsContent value="downtime">
**Downtime Not Accounted For**

A sprint is not limited to delivery or production. Many things happen between the two, such as email exchanges, stand-up meetings, etc. If these elements are not considered in the sprint duration, velocity may weaken.

**Solutions:**
- Account for meetings, code reviews, and administrative tasks
- Use capacity planning alongside velocity
- Track actual vs. planned capacity
</TabsContent>
</Tabs>

## Conclusion

Velocity is an important measure used by Scrum Masters and Product Owners to track their team's progress and ensure project success. Agile's fast response, rapid delivery, incremental, and iterative framework ensures rapid releases, quality products, and customer satisfaction.

<Note type="success">
Velocity helps determine project timelines and allows product owners to provide accurate estimates without falling into the overcommitment trap.
</Note>

**Key takeaways:**
- Velocity is a team-specific metric that improves with experience
- Use it for planning and forecasting, not for comparing teams
- Focus on trends and consistency rather than absolute values
- Combine with other metrics for a complete picture of team performance

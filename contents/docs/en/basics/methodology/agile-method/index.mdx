# Agile Methodology & SCRUM

Managing a project following the Agile manifesto places the **customer** at the center of the project's life cycle. By including the customer in the project setup process, the Agile team can adjust the project's development based on the evolving customer needs over time.

## The 4 Values of the Agile Method

The Agile methodology is built upon four core values that prioritize adaptability and human collaboration:

<Stepper>
  <StepperItem title="Team">
    **Individuals** and **interactions** over **processes** and **tools**
  </StepperItem>
  <StepperItem title="Application">
    **Operational features** over **comprehensive documentation**
  </StepperItem>
  <StepperItem title="Collaboration">
    **Collaboration with customers** over **contractual negotiation**
  </StepperItem>
  <StepperItem title="Adaptation">
    **Adaptability** to change over **following a rigid plan**
  </StepperItem>
</Stepper>

## Fundamental Principles of the Agile Method

### Productivity

<Note type="success">
**Key productivity principles:**
- Regularly deliver functional solutions
- **Prioritize important tasks**
- Segment project production
- Maintain a strict guideline during project development
- Embrace simplicity and the art of maximizing the amount of work **not done**
</Note>

### Customer Communication

<Note type="info">
**Customer-centered approach:**
- **The customer is part of the team**
- Maintain **continuous communication** with the customer
- Establish a **trustworthy relationship** with the customer
</Note>

### Communication

- Team adaptation and improvement
- Prioritize human contact
- **Human contact facilitates understanding of different stakeholder constraints**
- Verbal and non-verbal communication (face-to-face communication)
- Self-responsibility of team members

## SCRUM Framework

SCRUM is a **framework** for implementing the Agile methodology **incrementally** and **iteratively**.

### Roles

<Tabs>
<TabsList>
<TabsTrigger value="po">Product Owner</TabsTrigger>
<TabsTrigger value="sm">Scrum Master</TabsTrigger>
<TabsTrigger value="dev">Development Team</TabsTrigger>
</TabsList>

<TabsContent value="po">
### Product Owner

The **Product Owner** (PO) plays a critical role with a significant workload. They are responsible for **communication** between the **customer** and the **team**. The PO **organizes** the **Product Backlog** based on **task prioritization** and generally oversees the project's lifecycle.

**Key responsibilities:**
- Manage the Product Backlog
- Define user stories and requirements
- Prioritize features based on business value
- Act as the voice of the customer
</TabsContent>

<TabsContent value="sm">
### Scrum Master

The **SCRUM Master** is responsible for ensuring that the **SCRUM framework** is correctly implemented and is also in charge of **facilitating Agile rituals**.

**Key responsibilities:**
- Facilitate SCRUM ceremonies
- Remove impediments for the team
- Coach the team on Agile practices
- Protect the team from external distractions
</TabsContent>

<TabsContent value="dev">
### Development Team

The development team consists of **developers** who are responsible for **building project features**.

**Key characteristics:**
- Self-organizing and cross-functional
- Typically 3-9 members
- Collectively responsible for delivering the product increment
- Makes technical decisions
</TabsContent>
</Tabs>

## Backlogs

### The Product Backlog

The **Product Backlog** is a **registry** from which the team selects **tasks to be completed**. The Product Backlog is filled by the **Product Owner** and may contain:

<Note type="info">
**User Stories**: User stories are **simple tasks** explaining a product feature. User stories can be broken down into **sub-tasks** that serve as **steps toward completing the related user story**. 

**Format**: "**As a..., I can..., so that...**" or "**As a..., I must..., so that...**"

**Example**: "As a learner, I must log in to participate in my class."

User stories answer **`Who? What? Why?`**, and it's up to the **developer** to answer **`How?`**.
</Note>

<Note type="success">
**Epics**: Epics are a **group of user stories**. Generally, epics represent a complete feature, whereas **user stories** represent **fragments of a feature**. 

**Example**: An epic might be `User Authentication` and could contain multiple user stories related to login, registration, password reset, etc.
</Note>

### The Sprint Backlog

The **Sprint Backlog** is a **registry** containing **tasks to be performed** to deliver a feature. Once a sprint is completed, the team gathers for **Agile retrospective rituals** to identify different **improvement areas** and define new tasks for the next sprint.

![SCRUM Cycle](/images/docs/assets/agile-method/cycle.jpeg)

## SCRUM Ceremonies

### Sprint Planning

**Sprint Planning** is a **SCRUM ritual** that brings together the **Product Owner** and the **development team** to **plan the upcoming sprint**. Together, they create a task list to place in the **Sprint Backlog**, based on **task priority** or the **previous iteration**.

<Note type="success">
At the end of Sprint Planning, the development team knows which tasks need to be completed in the next sprint and has a clear understanding of the sprint goal.
</Note>

### Daily Meeting (Stand-up)

The **Daily Meeting** is a ritual primarily led by the development team and, as the name suggests, it occurs **daily**, generally before starting work on the project (also known as a **Stand-Up Meeting**). This ritual should not exceed **15 minutes** for efficiency.

During this ritual, team members answer the following questions:

<Stepper>
  <StepperItem title="Yesterday">
    **What did I do yesterday?**
  </StepperItem>
  <StepperItem title="Obstacles">
    **What obstacles did I encounter?**
  </StepperItem>
  <StepperItem title="Today">
    **What will I do today?**
  </StepperItem>
</Stepper>

<Note type="warning">
If a significant issue is raised, it should be addressed in a separate **meeting to resolve it** - don't let the daily meeting run over time.
</Note>

### Sprint Review

The **Sprint Review** is the only ritual that **includes project stakeholders**. This ritual brings together:

- The customer
- The SCRUM Master
- The Product Owner
- The development team

<Note type="info">
The review typically lasts **1 hour per week of the sprint**, meaning that if a sprint lasts 2 weeks, the review will take 2 hours.
</Note>

This ritual is used for the team to present the **project's progress** to all stakeholders. This way, the customer can express their impressions about the project and suggest any necessary adjustments.

<Note type="warning">
It may happen that, at the end of a sprint, the **Product Owner cancels this ritual** for some reasons, including when the sprint encountered difficulties in being completed and is, therefore, **not presentable**.
</Note>

### Sprint Retrospective

The **Sprint Retrospective** is a ritual used by the development team to **identify what happened during the last sprint**. This ritual brings together:

- The SCRUM Master
- The development team

<Note type="success">
The purpose of this ritual is not to highlight what didn't work but to **highlight what went well** and the **areas for improvement that the SCRUM Master can guide the team towards** to correct what went wrong.
</Note>

This ritual can last up to **4 hours** due to its nature and importance for continuous improvement.

## Organizational Tools

### Jira

![Jira Illustration](/images/docs/assets/agile-method/jira/illu.jpg)

Jira is a collaborative service that allows the application of the Agile methodology through its design. It can be used with the SCRUM framework and KANBAN. If you need to work in Agile methodology using the SCRUM framework, Jira is by far the best candidate and is, for all intents and purposes, mandatory in any respectable industry-related organization.

#### Getting Started with Jira

Jira is an online service that provides a range of user-friendly tools accessible through a clean and ergonomic interface.

<Note type="info">
While it may seem complex at first, it is a highly comprehensive tool that will save you a lot of time in project management.
</Note>

Let's take a look at the basic Jira interface:

![Basic Interface](/images/docs/assets/agile-method/jira/basic-interface.png)

This is the interface that developers typically encounter. Note that this interface is specific to a SCRUM project; it is different for a Kanban project.

#### Sprint Planning Interface

Here is the interface used during **Sprint Planning**:

![Product Backlog Interface](/images/docs/assets/agile-method/jira/product-backlog.png)

This interface represents the **Product Backlog** and is used to transfer tasks to the **Sprint Backlog**. This way, the team takes the priority tasks and moves them into the Sprint space. Once the Sprint begins, tasks are automatically transferred to the **Board**.

#### Sprint Board

Here is what the **Board** looks like when a **Sprint** starts:

![Sprint Board](/images/docs/assets/agile-method/jira/sprint-board.png)

It resembles a Kanban board with columns typically like:
- **To Do** - Tasks not yet started
- **In Progress** - Tasks currently being worked on  
- **Done** - Completed tasks

<Note type="warning">
At the end of the sprint (the end date can be defined when creating the sprint), tasks not completed are returned to the **Product Backlog**.
</Note>

## Summary

- **Agile methodology** puts the customer at the center and values adaptability over rigid processes
- **SCRUM** is a framework that implements Agile principles through defined roles and ceremonies
- **Product Owner** manages the backlog and represents customer needs
- **Scrum Master** facilitates the process and removes impediments
- **Development Team** builds the product features
- **Ceremonies** (Sprint Planning, Daily Standup, Sprint Review, Retrospective) ensure continuous communication and improvement
- **Jira** is the industry-standard tool for managing Agile/SCRUM projects

<Note>
This introduction covers the fundamental aspects of Agile and SCRUM. Both methodologies are extremely comprehensive and go beyond what has been presented here, but these basics will give you a solid foundation for effective project management.

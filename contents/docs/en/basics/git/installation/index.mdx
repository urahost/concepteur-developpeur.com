Git installation varies depending on your operating system. This guide covers installation methods for the most common platforms.

## On Windows

To install Git on Windows, you can [download it here](https://git-scm.com/download/win).

<Note type="info">
The Windows installer includes a GUI client and command-line tools. During installation, you can configure Git to work with your preferred terminal and text editor.
</Note>

## On Mac (Homebrew)

For Mac, using **Homebrew** is the recommended approach:

```sh
brew install git
```

<Note>
If you don't have Homebrew installed, you can get it from [brew.sh](https://brew.sh) or use the official Git installer from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/download/mac).
</Note>

## On Linux

For Linux, installation depends on your package manager (based on your distribution).

### Using APT (Ubuntu/Debian)

```sh
sudo apt-get install git
```

### Using Pacman (Arch Linux)

```sh
sudo pacman -S git
```

<Note type="success">
After installation, verify Git is properly installed by running `git --version` in your terminal. This will display the installed Git version.

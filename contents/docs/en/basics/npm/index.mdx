## What is Npm (Node Package Manager)

Npm is a **node package manager** used to import or publish Node packages with other developers who use Npm.

Npm is divided into 3 major parts:

### 1. Npm Website

The [Npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) website is useful to know which Node packages are available on the Registry.

### 2. CLI (Command Line Interface)

The CLI is the biggest part of Npm, because it's by the CLI that you'll **interact with Npm** and with the registry to **import packages** or **publish your packages**.

### 3. Npm Registry

The **Npm registry** is a kind of huge **database** that stores **complete functional applications** and mostly **node packages** that you can **download** to use or **adapt** them to your needs.

## What is Npx (Node Package Executer)

Npx is a **Node package executer**.
Npx allows you to run remote packages, that means you don't have to **download** them to **run** them, you can just run packages remotely by your **CLI** from the **registry**, it can be useful to run **complete functional applications**.

<Note>
Generally, we prefer to perform remote runs on light applications.
</Note>

## Node Packages

A Node package is a file or a folder described by a file named **package.json** (most often a folder).

The **package.json** file will provide several information about your package, that's why you must fill it carefully with detailed information.

A Node package can be public or private, [Read more about package visibility](https://docs.npmjs.com/about-private-packages), it can also be restrained to a particular scope. [Read more about packages scopes](https://docs.npmjs.com/about-scopes)

A Node package can be all of the following (and even more):

1. A file or a folder described by a **package.json** file
2. A compressed file containing (1.)
3. An URL pointing to (2.)
4. A URL of GitHub repository that when cloned results in something formed as (1.)

## Node Modules

Node modules are dependencies that your package may need to run, or just used for the development cycle of your package/application.

A Node Module can be:

- A folder
- A `.js` file

You can see modules in the `node_modules` folder.

<Note type="warning">
A node module can be incompletely downloaded for some reason, in that case, it's recommended to remove the `node_modules` folder and reinstall packages.
</Note>

As an image is worth a thousand words:

<Image src="/images/docs/assets/heavy-modules.png" alt="Humorous illustration showing the enormous size of the node_modules folder" />

This image explains how heavy Node modules are.

<Note type="warning">
It's highly recommended not to forget omitting the `node_modules` folder in your `.gitignore` to not push them to your remote repository.
</Note>

## The package.json file

As explained above, the **package.json** file is essential to your Node package.

This file is like a map to your package, you'll provide many information in this file.

```json
{
  "name": "Your package name",
  "version": "Your package version",
  "description": "The package description",
  "keywords": ["Optional field for package discovery"],
  "homepage": "Reference page of your package",
  "bugs": "Where users report bugs",
  "author": "Some information about you",
  "main": "Application entry point (usually index.js)",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "Advanced configuration for your package"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "express": "4.18.3"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "winston": "^2.0.20"
  },
  "private": true
}
```

Npm will set default values to skipped fields, for instance, for the `script` field, Npm will set a test default value for this field.

## Semantic Versioning

Semantic Versioning is a standard that you should follow when you release significant modifications to your packages.

It's recommended to publish your changes with different versions, changing the `version` field in your `package.json` file.

That way other developers using your package can follow what changes you bring for each version.

To understand the following, you must understand some terms:

- **MAJOR**: A version that's not backwards compatible, which brings breaking changes
- **MINOR**: A version that brings some changes (like adding a new feature), but keeps your package backwards compatible
- **PATCH**: A version that brings bug fixes and keeps backwards compatible (most often)

### Semantic versioning specifications

- It's recommended to start your package development at `1.0.0` version
- When you want to release PATCH changes, your package will pass to `1.0.1` version
- When you want to release MINOR changes, your package will pass to `1.1.0` version (PATCH digit returned to 0)
- When you want to release MAJOR changes, your package will pass to `2.0.0` version (MINOR digit returned to 0)

<Note>
Digits aren't limited to 9, a version `2.3.19` is completely correct.
</Note>

## Differences between `dependencies` and `devDependencies`

The field `dependencies` allows you to list which dependencies your package will need to run.
The field `devDependencies` allows you to list which dependencies your package will need to work in the development phase.

### Example

Let's take an example, imagine that you want to bake a cake:

To prepare your cake what do you **need**?
Maybe a fork to beat eggs.

Ok, but you can also take this fork to eat your cake.

In that example, that fork is a `devDependency` **AND** a `dependency`.

Because you'll need this fork to prepare it and to eat it.

## The package-lock.json file

The `package-lock.json` file is automatically generated by Npm when an operation on the `node_modules` tree occurs.
The `package-lock.json` will contain a reliable description of the evolution of the `node_modules` tree.

This file is supposed to be included in the repo, it can be useful to:

- Obtain only one version of `node_modules` tree and ensure continuous integration principles
- Obtain an easy way to retrieve `node_modules` states
- Obtain better visibility on changes of dependencies tree
- Optimize dependencies installation, to not redownload already installed dependencies

## Essential Commands

### Initialize a Node Project

If you wish to initialize a Node project, you'll need to type this command:

```bash
npm init
```

This command has to be executed in the root folder of your project.

It will ask you some parameters and create the `package.json` file.

### Installing dependencies

#### Production dependencies

You'll certainly need to import dependencies in your project, to do that, use the command:

```bash
npm install <package_name>
# or
npm i <package_name>
```

Let's take a real example:

```bash
npm install express
```

This command will download Express library files into the `node_modules` folder (folder that will be automatically created if it doesn't exist yet).

#### Development dependencies

If you wish to download dependencies only for the development phase, you must know this flag:

```bash
npm install <package_name> --save-dev
```

Real example:

```bash
npm install winston --save-dev
```

This command will download `Winston` in your `node_modules` and define it as `devDependencies` in your `package.json` file.

#### Reinstalling dependencies

In case you want to import a Node project without `node_modules` or you lose yours for some reason, you could need to redownload all dependencies, for that case, you should know this command:

```bash
npm install
```

This command will read `dependencies` and `devDependencies` and download each package.

<Note>
You can use the command `npm install --dev` to download only development dependencies.
